        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Akshay Chandra, a 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student at Netaji Subhash Engineering College. With a passion for coding and web development, I've built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and Java, while also gaining experience with Python and C. Currently, I'm expanding my skills by learning JavaScript to bring more interactivity to the projects I work on.

            I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, eager to tackle new challenges, and committed to creating innovative solutions. Whether it's building sleek, responsive websites or writing efficient, clean code, I'm always up for a new project.
            
            Feel free to explore my portfolio to see what Iâ€™ve been working on!

              I completed my scooling from <u>Rajendra Vidyalaya</u>, a ICSE based private school in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. I completed my 10<sup>th</sup> in 2021 with 96% and then continued my high school here only in pure science stream. I finished my 12<sup>th</sup> in 2023 with 90% marks. Also during this time my interest in coding grew and I started learning Java and was among the best coders in my school. I learned GitHub, VSCode and continued my journey in coding. It was during this time that I also learned Python as a hobby.
