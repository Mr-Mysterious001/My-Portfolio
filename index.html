          Hi! I'm Akshay Chandra, a 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering
          student at Netaji Subhash Engineering College. With a passion for
          coding and web development, I've built a solid foundation in HTML,
          CSS, and Java, while also gaining experience with Python and C.
          Currently, I'm expanding my skills by learning JavaScript to bring
          more interactivity to the projects I work on. I'm excited to continue
          learning and growing as a developer, eager to tackle new challenges,
          and committed to creating innovative solutions. Whether it's building
          sleek, responsive websites or writing efficient, clean code, I'm
          always up for a new project. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see
          what Iâ€™ve been working on!

              I completed my scooling from <u>Rajendra Vidyalaya</u>, a ICSE
              based private school in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. I completed my
              10<sup>th</sup> in 2021 with 96% and then continued my high school
              here only in pure science stream. I finished my 12<sup>th</sup> in
              2023 with 90% marks. Also during this time my interest in coding
              grew and I started learning Java and was among the best coders in
              my school. I learned GitHub, VSCode and continued my journey in
              coding. It was during this time that I also learned Python as a
              hobby.
